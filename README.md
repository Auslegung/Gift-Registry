# Gift-Registry
A gift registry website that is free from association with any single
store.  Among other things, it allows a user to indicate if an item can be
purchased used or not, which is more pertinent for baby registries than
other kinds of registries.

## 1. Technologies Used
-I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ANU4xu98) for all planning, breaking
things up into `Bugs`, `To Do`, `Working On`, `Not Functioning as Desired`,
`Functioning as Desired`, and `Complete`.  I used labels to indicate if the card
was a MVP requirement for the project, a reach goal, or a personal reach goal.

-I used [creately.com](https://creately.com/diagram/itubigp51/LcRG9WTAPfuFpacGpTrRA4cOFg%3D) for ERD, site diagramming, and file/directory structures.

-I used [Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com/free-wireframing-tool) for wireframing.


## 2. My Approach
### Planning
Throughout Monday I planned out the project by creating a trello board,
wireframe, ERD, site diagram, directory structure, and the routes I would need.
Monday night I began scaffolding the routes so that they would simply show
'working'.  

### More Planning

### Executing

### Tweaking

## 3. Unsolved Problems
self-explanatory

## 4. Notes to Self
notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.

## 5. User Stories
